# Harmonia - Mental Health & Wellness Platform (Student Module)

## Overview
This repository contains my individual contributions to "Harmonia," a group web development project focused on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and final output. 

As **Student 4** in the development team, I was responsible for the User Profile architecture, the content strategy for Mental Health, and the technical implementation of the site's interactive navigation map.

## Key Features I Built

### 1. Interactive SVG Sitemap
- **Technology:** Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) & JavaScript.
- **Functionality:** I wrote a custom JS script (`sitemap.js`) to dynamically calculate the SVG `viewBox` based on window size, ensuring the sitemap is fully responsive on mobile and desktop.
- **Accessibility:** Implemented keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter) for the SVG nodes using ARIA roles.

### 2. User Profile Dashboard
- **Layout:** Utilized **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to create a responsive card-based layout.
- **Components:** Created animated skill progress bars, a semantic availability table, and interactive form elements.

### 3. Collaborative Design
- Adhered to a strict **Global CSS** variable system (`:root`) to ensure my pages matched the visual identity created by the team lead.
- Implemented consistent hover states and transitions as per the design specification.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML5 (Semantic)
- CSS3 (Variables, Grid, Flexbox, Animations)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners)
- W3C Validation standards
